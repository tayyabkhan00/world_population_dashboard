🌍 World Population Dashboard — Overview

The World Population Dashboard is an interactive Streamlit application that visualizes global population trends from 1950 to 2023. It provides a powerful and user-friendly interface to explore how different countries and regions have grown over time using dynamic charts, maps, and comparison tools.

This dashboard uses synthetic population data generated within the app (for demo purposes), and showcases how Plotly, Streamlit, and Python can be used to build real-time, data-driven visual analytics applications.
